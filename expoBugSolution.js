The solutions will vary greatly depending on the specific error. Common solutions include:

1. **Checking and updating dependencies:** Run `expo update` and `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible.
2. **Cleaning the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall all dependencies.
3. **Checking the Expo SDK version:** Make sure the SDK version in your `app.json` or `expo.json` file is compatible with your dependencies and Expo CLI version.
4. **Reviewing the logs:** Carefully examine the error logs provided by the Expo CLI. The specific error message and stack trace can offer valuable clues for resolving the issue.
5. **Ejecting (if necessary):** In cases where managing native modules or customizing the build process is essential, consider ejecting from the Expo managed workflow.  This will offer more granular control, but sacrifices some of the convenience of the managed setup.
6. **Searching for similar issues:** Use the error message as a search query on the Expo forums and GitHub issues to see if others have encountered and resolved similar problems.
